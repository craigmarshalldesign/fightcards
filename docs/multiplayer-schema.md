# InstantDB Multiplayer Schema

Multiplayer relies on deterministic, append-only events stored in InstantDB. This document describes the data model used by the client and the recommended rules to enforce fair play.

## Entities Overview

### InstantDB Schema Snippet

```ts
import { i } from '@instantdb/core';

export const schema = i.schema({
  entities: {
    lobbies: i.entity({
      status: i.string().optional(),
      hostUserId: i.string().optional(),
      hostDisplayName: i.string().optional(),
      hostColor: i.string().optional(),
      hostReady: i.boolean().optional(),
      guestUserId: i.string().optional(),
      guestDisplayName: i.string().optional(),
      guestColor: i.string().optional(),
      guestReady: i.boolean().optional(),
      searchKey: i.string().optional(),
      matchId: i.string().optional(),
      createdAt: i.number().optional(),
      updatedAt: i.number().optional(),
    }),
    matches: i.entity({
      lobbyId: i.string().optional(),
      status: i.string().optional(),
      activePlayer: i.number().optional(),
      turn: i.number().optional(),
      phase: i.string().optional(),
      dice: i.json().optional(),
      state: i.json().optional(),
      pendingAction: i.json().optional(),
      nextSequence: i.number().optional(),
      createdAt: i.number().optional(),
      updatedAt: i.number().optional(),
      hostUserId: i.string().optional(),
      guestUserId: i.string().optional(),
    }),
    matchEvents: i.entity({
      matchId: i.string().optional(),
      sequence: i.number().optional(),
      type: i.string().optional(),
      payload: i.json().optional(),
      createdAt: i.number().optional(),
    }),
  },
  links: {},
  rooms: {},
});
```

### Security & Rule Parameters

- Multiplayer reads and writes include InstantDB `ruleParams` so lobbies, matches, and match events land in a shared, public scope.
- By default the client sends `{ visibility: 'public' }`. Override the key or value with `VITE_INSTANTDB_MULTIPLAYER_RULE_KEY` and `VITE_INSTANTDB_MULTIPLAYER_RULE_VALUE` if your rules expect different identifiers.
- Configure InstantDB rules to allow read/write access whenever the provided rule parameters match the public multiplayer scope. This ensures every signed-in user can see and join newly created lobbies immediately.

### ID Generation

InstantDB validates that entity primary keys are UUID strings. The client uses `crypto.randomUUID()` (with a deterministic fallback for environments that lack the Web Crypto API) via `generateId()` so that lobby, match, and match-event records always satisfy that requirement.

### `lobbies`
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Lobby id generated client-side via `generateId()`. |
| `status` | string | `'open' \| 'ready' \| 'starting' \| 'playing' \| 'completed' \| 'abandoned'`; defaults to `'open'`. |
| `hostUserId` | string | Lobby owner (Instant user id). Empty string means the seat is open. |
| `hostDisplayName` | string | Cached host name shown in listings. Empty string when unknown. |
| `hostColor` | string | Selected deck color for the host seat (empty string until chosen). |
| `hostReady` | boolean | Host ready flag (`false` until the host readies up). |
| `guestUserId` | string | Guest user id (`''` when unclaimed). |
| `guestDisplayName` | string | Guest display name (`''` when unclaimed). |
| `guestColor` | string | Guest deck color (`''` until chosen). |
| `guestReady` | boolean | Guest ready flag. |
| `searchKey` | string | Lower-cased host name used for search filtering. |
| `matchId` | string | Match activated for the lobby (empty string while waiting). |
| `createdAt` | number | Unix epoch (ms) when the lobby was created. |
| `updatedAt` | number | Unix epoch (ms) when the lobby last changed; used for stale cleanup. |

> **Note:** Optional seat/display fields are written as empty strings while the slot is open. The client also prunes host-owned lobbies that stay open without a guest for longer than 60 seconds by deleting the record from InstantDB.

### Client Lobby Flow

- The lobby browser subscribes to the 20 most recent entries (using the public rule scope described above) and sorts them by `updatedAt` (falling back to `createdAt` when missing) so newly active rooms bubble to the top of the list. Filtering to `open`, `ready`, `starting`, and `playing` states now happens client-side to avoid schema validation issues when optional fields are absent.
- A manual **Refresh** control re-runs the subscription query on demand so players can immediately pull in lobbies created from other devices. Subscription failures surface an inline error allowing players to retry.
- Seat updates (claiming/leaving, deck choices, ready toggles) optimistically update the local lobby state while the InstantDB transaction completes, ensuring UI controls reflect the current selection immediately.
- Player name search is performed entirely client-side by matching the lower-cased `hostDisplayName` and `guestDisplayName` fields. The `searchKey` column exists to speed up server-side filtering if rules are added later.
- Before creating a new lobby, the host deletes any of their previous open rooms that have been idle for 60 seconds. This keeps the listing clean and prevents duplicate "ghost" lobbies from appearing across multiple devices.
- Joining a lobby installs a dedicated subscription for that record so seat changes, deck picks, and ready states stream into the detail view without polling.
- Hosts immediately delete their lobby if they navigate back to the lobby list, refresh the page, or start a match. A 60 second TTL (tracked via `updatedAt`) also removes abandoned lobbies if the client disconnects unexpectedly.
- The client stores the most recent lobby id in `localStorage` so it can be cleaned up automatically after a crash or refresh when the player signs back in.
- The lobby detail screen renders distinct experiences: the host sees only their deck selection plus an opponent status panel, while guests see host readiness alongside their own deck picker. When both seats are filled, additional visitors are shown a locked state and prompted to browse other lobbies or create their own instead of spectating.
- Joining a lobby is exclusive to a single guest seat; once a challenger claims it, the lobby becomes locked and no other accounts can join until a seat re-opens.

### `matches`
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Match id generated with `generateId()` |
| `lobbyId` | string | Parent lobby id |
| `status` | string | `'starting' \| 'in-progress' \| 'completed' \| 'abandoned'` |
| `activePlayer` | number | Seat index of active player (0 host, 1 guest) |
| `turn` | number | Current turn |
| `phase` | string | Current phase (`'main1'`, `'combat'`, `'main2'`) |
| `dice` | object | `{ host: number, guest: number, winner: 0 \| 1 }` |
| `state` | object | Optional snapshot for game restoration (event replay is primary mechanism) |
| `pendingAction` | object | Optional pending action snapshot (event replay is primary mechanism) |
| `nextSequence` | number | Next `matchEvents.sequence` to assign |
| `createdAt` | number | Unix epoch |
| `updatedAt` | number | Unix epoch |

| `matchId` | string | Owning match |
| `sequence` | number | Strictly increasing sequence number |
| `type` | string | Event type (see below) |
| `payload` | object | Event payload |

## Event Authoring Rules

- Only the active seat may write turn or card events; InstantDB rules should verify `matches.activePlayer` matches the caller.
- Every event must bump `matches.nextSequence` alongside the new entry in the same transaction.
- Clients replay events strictly by sequence; if a gap appears, they wait until the missing event arrives.
- Events should carry minimal payloads (card id/instance) and rely on local card data for full details.

## Client Replay Notes

- Upon subscribing to a match, clients rebuild `state.game` by applying events sequentially.
- Pending actions are reconstructed from `pending-*` events so both seats see identical selection prompts.
- Card zone changes (`card-played`, `card_left_battlefield`, `creature-destroyed`) are applied before combat/pending logic to maintain consistency.

## Recommended Instant Rules (High Level)

1. `lobbies`: only hosts may update their own seat; seat ready flags must correspond to the seat owner.
2. `matches`: only seats present in the match may write events.
3. `matchEvents`: reject events where `sequence` != `matches.nextSequence`; enforce turn ownership/seat-specific actions.
4. `matches.status`: transitions must follow lobby ready states (open → starting → in-progress → completed/abandoned).

These rules keep gameplay synchronized and prevent race conditions or unauthorized moves.

## Verified Working Features ✅

This section documents all multiplayer features that have been tested and confirmed working correctly, along with the implementation patterns used.

### Core Synchronization Pattern

**Principle:** Deterministic Event Replay
- Events DO NOT contain full state changes
- Events trigger the SAME game logic on both clients
- Both players execute identical functions when replaying events
- This ensures perfect synchronization without massive payloads

**Critical Rule:** Local vs Remote Execution
- Single-player mode: Execute game logic immediately
- Multiplayer mode: Emit event ONLY, then return (no local execution)
- Event replay: Both players execute the same game logic
- This prevents double-execution bugs

### 1. Combat System ✅

#### Auto-Populating Attackers
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When `COMBAT_STARTED` event is emitted, payload includes `controller` only
- On event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 493-507):
  - Both clients find eligible attackers (untapped creatures without summoning sickness)
  - Use `buildInitialAttackers()` to create identical attacker arrays
  - Populate `game.combat.attackers` deterministically
- **Key:** No random selection; eligibility is deterministic based on game state

#### Declare Attackers Flow
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When active player clicks "Declare Attackers", `confirmAttackers()` is called
- **In multiplayer** (`src/app/game/combat/attackers.js` lines 65-93):
  - Emits `ATTACKERS_CONFIRMED` event with attacker data
  - Returns immediately WITHOUT calling `startTriggerStage()` locally
- Event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 510-531):
  - Both clients reconstruct full attacker objects from battlefield
  - Both clients call `startTriggerStage()` to process onAttack triggers
  - This ensures defending player enters trigger/blocking phase

#### Declare Blockers Flow
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- After triggers resolve, `finalizeTriggerStage()` is called
- **Changed approach** (`src/app/game/combat/triggers.js` lines 69-81):
  - Previously emitted `BLOCKING_STARTED` event (caused "replayingEvents" guard issue)
  - Now calls `prepareBlocks()` directly on both clients
  - This works because `ATTACKERS_CONFIRMED` replay already put both clients in correct state
- Defending player sees "Declare Blockers" button and can assign blockers
- Each blocker assignment emits `BLOCKER_ASSIGNED` event

#### Combat Damage Resolution
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When blockers confirmed, `resolveCombat()` builds damage log
- **In multiplayer** (`src/app/game/combat/resolution.js` lines 137-142):
  - Emits `COMBAT_RESOLVED` event with damage log
  - Does NOT apply damage locally
- Event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 553-613):
  - Both clients iterate through damage log
  - Look up full creature objects from battlefield
  - Apply damage using `dealDamageToCreature()` and `dealDamageToPlayer()`
  - Call `checkForDeadCreatures()` to move dead creatures to graveyard
- **Result:** Both players see identical damage, creature deaths, and graveyard contents

#### Attack Arrows (UI)
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- `renderAttackLines()` in `src/app/ui/views/game/battlefield.js`
- Uses `getLocalSeatIndex()` to determine perspective
- Arrow targets adjusted based on local player vs remote player view
- Arrows point from attacker to defending player's life orb correctly for both perspectives

### 2. Spell Casting ✅

#### Spell Targeting Arrows
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Active player prepares spell, enters targeting mode
- Each target selection calls `selectTargetForPending()`
- **Critical fix** (`src/app/game/core/pending.js` lines 78-93):
  - Immediately emits `PENDING_UPDATED` event with current `selectedTargets`
  - This makes arrows visible to opponent in real-time
  - When requirement finalized, emits another `PENDING_UPDATED` with cleared `selectedTargets` and filled `chosenTargets`
- Event replay updates `game.pendingAction.selectedTargets` for both players
- `renderTargetLines()` uses `getLocalSeatIndex()` to point arrows correctly
- **Result:** Both players see targeting arrows pointing to correct targets

#### Spell Execution (No Double-Casting)
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When spell targets chosen and confirmed, `executeSpell()` is called
- **In multiplayer** (`src/app/game/core/pending.js` lines 344-353):
  - Emits `PENDING_RESOLVED` event with spell data
  - Returns immediately WITHOUT executing effects locally
- Event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 810-848):
  - Both clients reconstruct pending action
  - Reconstruct full target objects from battlefield (not stubs)
  - Spend mana on both clients
  - Call `resolveEffects()` on both clients
  - Move card to graveyard on both clients
  - Log spell cast
- **Result:** Spell executes exactly once (via event replay), visible to both players

#### Mana Spending
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Mana spending happens during `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay
- Both clients call `spendMana(player, pending.card.cost)`
- Mana display updates for both players immediately
- **Files:**
  - `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` line 843 (spells)
  - `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` line 868 (abilities)

### 3. Creature Abilities ✅

#### Activated Abilities (Targeting)
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When ability activated, `activateCreatureAbility()` is called
- **In multiplayer** (`src/app/game/core/flow.js` lines 291-303):
  - Emits `PENDING_CREATED` event with ability data
  - Returns WITHOUT executing locally
- Event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 728-788):
  - Distinguishes between `ability`/`trigger` (card on battlefield) vs `spell`/`summon` (card in hand)
  - For abilities: Finds creature on battlefield instead of removing from hand
  - Creates pending action with requirements
  - Both players see targeting UI
- Target selection uses same `PENDING_UPDATED` pattern as spells
- Resolution uses `PENDING_RESOLVED` event
- **Result:** Abilities work identically to spells with correct targeting arrows

#### Passive Triggers (onAttack)
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When `ATTACKERS_CONFIRMED` event is replayed, both clients call `startTriggerStage()`
- `startTriggerStage()` looks for `onAttack` passives on attacking creatures
- Creates pending actions for each trigger
- **Critical:** These are created during event replay, so no additional events needed
- Triggers resolve in sequence via `PENDING_RESOLVED` events
- **Result:** No double-execution; triggers fire once and both players see effects

#### Stat Buffs Visibility
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Buffs applied via `applyTemporaryBuff()` or `applyPermanentBuff()`
- Buffs stored in `creature.buffs` array
- `getCreatureStats()` calculates current stats including buffs
- Both clients apply buffs during event replay (via `resolveEffects()`)
- UI renders stats using `getCreatureStats()` which reads from local game state
- **Result:** Both players see identical creature stats (e.g., 2/2 becomes 4/2)

### 4. Graveyard Synchronization ✅

#### Spells to Graveyard
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- During `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay for spells
- Both clients execute: `player.graveyard.push(pending.card)`
- **File:** `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` line 847
- **Result:** Spell cards appear in graveyard for both players

#### Creatures Dying from Combat
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- `COMBAT_RESOLVED` event replay calls `checkForDeadCreatures()` on both clients
- `checkForDeadCreatures()` calls `destroyCreature()` for each dead creature
- `destroyCreature()` executes on both clients:
  - Removes from battlefield
  - Resets creature state
  - Adds to graveyard: `player.graveyard.push(creature)`
  - Logs death message
- **Files:**
  - `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` line 607 (calls checkForDeadCreatures)
  - `src/app/game/creatures.js` line 223 (adds to graveyard)
- **Result:** Dead creatures appear in graveyard for both players

#### Creatures Dying from Spell/Effect Damage
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Spell effects call `dealDamageToCreature()` during `resolveEffects()`
- After all effects resolve, calls `checkForDeadCreatures()`
- Same `destroyCreature()` flow as combat deaths
- Both clients execute this during `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay
- **Files:**
  - `src/app/game/core/effects.js` line 248 (checkForDeadCreatures after effects)
  - `src/app/game/creatures.js` line 223 (adds to graveyard)
- **Result:** Spell-killed creatures appear in graveyard for both players

#### Graveyard Viewing (UI Only)
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Graveyard modal is purely local UI - no synchronization needed
- Each player can open/close their own graveyard view independently
- Graveyard contents are part of game state, always synchronized

### 5. Turn and Phase Management ✅

#### Phase Transitions
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Phase changes emit `PHASE_CHANGED` event
- Both clients update `game.phase` during event replay
- UI updates (phase indicator, available actions) driven by local `game.phase`
- **Result:** Both players see synchronized phase transitions

#### Turn Changes
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- `endTurn()` emits `TURN_STARTED` event (handled in multiplayer flow)
- Updates `game.turn`, `game.currentPlayer`, `game.phase`
- Both clients refill mana and draw card via event replay
- **Result:** Clean turn transitions with synchronized state

### 6. Life Total Synchronization ✅

#### Life Changes
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- `dealDamageToPlayer()` emits `LIFE_CHANGED` event
- Event replay updates `game.players[controller].life` on both clients
- Calls `checkForWinner()` to detect game-over conditions
- **File:** `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 614-618
- **Result:** Both players see identical life totals

### 7. Card Summoning ✅

#### Creature Summoning
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- When creature summon resolves, emits `PENDING_RESOLVED` with `kind: 'summon'`
- Event replay (`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 792-807):
  - Both clients reconstruct full card from payload
  - Initialize creature properties via `initializeCreature()`
  - Add to battlefield: `player.battlefield.push(fullCard)`
  - Log summon message
- **Result:** Creatures appear on battlefield for both players

#### Token Creation
**Status:** Working correctly  
**Implementation:**
- Token creation emits `TOKEN_CREATED` event
- Both clients create identical token via `createCardInstance()`
- Add to battlefield during event replay
- **Result:** Tokens synchronized across both clients

### Common Patterns Used

#### Pattern 1: Event-Only in Multiplayer
```javascript
if (!isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
  // Execute immediately for single-player
  executeGameLogic();
} else {
  // Emit event and return - no local execution
  enqueueMatchEvent(EVENT_TYPE, payload);
  return;
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Deterministic Replay
```javascript
// In event replay handler
case EVENT_TYPES.SOME_EVENT:
  // Both clients reconstruct full objects from battlefield
  const fullObject = findInBattlefield(payload.id);
  // Both clients execute same game logic
  executeGameLogic(fullObject);
  break;
```

#### Pattern 3: Real-Time UI Updates
```javascript
// Emit event immediately when state changes
selectTarget(target) {
  game.pendingAction.selectedTargets.push(target);
  // Emit immediately so opponent sees arrow
  enqueueMatchEvent(PENDING_UPDATED, {
    selectedTargets: game.pendingAction.selectedTargets
  });
}
```

#### Pattern 4: Reconstructing Full Objects
```javascript
// Events contain minimal data (just instanceId)
// Replay reconstructs full objects from current game state
const fullCreature = game.players[controller].battlefield.find(
  c => c.instanceId === payload.creature.instanceId
);
```

### Known Working Event Flows

1. **Spell Cast Flow:**
   - `PENDING_CREATED` → UI shows spell targeting
   - `PENDING_UPDATED` (multiple) → Arrows update as targets selected
   - `PENDING_RESOLVED` → Spell executes, moves to graveyard
   - `DRAW_CARD` (if spell draws cards) → Both players draw cards
   - `TOKEN_CREATED` (if spell creates tokens) → Both players create token

2. **Combat Flow:**
   - `COMBAT_STARTED` → Both clients populate eligible attackers
   - `ATTACKERS_CONFIRMED` → Both clients process onAttack triggers
   - `BLOCKER_ASSIGNED` (multiple) → Defending player assigns blockers
   - `COMBAT_RESOLVED` → Both clients apply damage, check for deaths

3. **Ability Activation Flow:**
   - `PENDING_CREATED` → UI shows ability targeting
   - `PENDING_UPDATED` (multiple) → Arrows update as targets selected
   - `PENDING_RESOLVED` → Ability executes, mana spent

## Bug Fixes and Lessons Learned 🐛

This section documents bugs that were discovered during playtesting and how they were fixed.

### Bug Fix #1: Hand Count Desynchronization (Draw Effects)

**Symptom:** When player cast "Blazing Inspiration" (draw 2 cards), hand counts displayed incorrectly. One screen showed both players with 6 cards, the other showed 9 and 6 cards.

**Root Cause:** Double-execution bug in `src/app/game/core/effects.js` (lines 67-76). The `draw` effect was calling `drawCards()` locally AND emitting a `DRAW_CARD` event. This caused:
- Caster drew cards twice (once locally when effect resolved, once during event replay)
- Opponent drew cards once (only during event replay)
- Result: Caster had 3 extra cards (drew 2 twice instead of once)

**Fix:** Modified the `draw` effect to use the standard multiplayer pattern:
- In single-player: Execute `drawCards()` immediately
- In multiplayer: ONLY emit event, don't execute locally
- Event replay: Both players execute `drawCards()` via `DRAW_CARD` event handler

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/effects.js` lines 67-81 (added multiplayer guard)
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 632-640 (fixed `DRAW_CARD` handler to actually draw cards)

**Lesson:** ALL effects that modify game state must follow the event-only pattern in multiplayer. Never execute locally AND emit an event, or you get double-execution bugs.

### Bug Fix #2: Token Creatures Not Dealing Damage + Duplicate Sequence Numbers

**Symptom:** Token creature from "Phoenix Call" could attack but dealt no damage. Event log showed duplicate sequence numbers (41, 42, 43, 44 appearing twice each).

**Root Causes:**
1. **Token Double-Creation:** Same double-execution pattern as draw bug. Token was added to battlefield locally AND via event, causing duplicate/phantom tokens.
2. **Sequence Race Condition:** Multiple rapid events (combat deaths) read the same `match.nextSequence` value before any database update completed, causing duplicate sequence numbers.

**Fixes:**

**Token Creation Fix:**
- Modified `createToken` effect in `src/app/game/core/effects.js` (lines 130-146)
- Now follows standard multiplayer pattern: only emit event, don't add to battlefield locally
- Fixed `TOKEN_CREATED` event handler in `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (lines 473-484) to actually create the token

**Sequence Race Fix:**
- Modified `enqueueMatchEvent()` in `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (lines 120-157)
- Now immediately increments `match.nextSequence` in local state before creating event
- This ensures rapid successive calls use different sequence numbers
- Rollback on error to maintain consistency

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/effects.js` lines 130-146 (added multiplayer guard for tokens)
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 120-157 (optimistic sequence increment)
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 473-484 (fixed `TOKEN_CREATED` handler)

**Lesson:** 
1. Event sequence numbers must be allocated atomically to prevent race conditions during rapid event creation (like combat resolution)
2. Token creation follows the same pattern as all other state changes: event-only in multiplayer
3. Event handlers must actually perform the action, not just log it!

### Bug Fix #3: Hand Count Desynchronization (Card Play)

**Symptom:** After playing cards (spells or creatures), the hand count was correct for the player who played the card, but incorrect for the opponent. For example, playing "Blitz Formation" showed hand count as 5 for the caster but 6 for the opponent. Playing "Flame Sprite" showed 5 cards for the player but 6 for the opponent.

**Root Cause:** Cards were being removed from hand locally when played, but this removal was not synchronized during event replay for the opponent. There are three different flows for playing cards:

1. **Spells** → `prepareSpell()` removes from hand locally → `PENDING_CREATED` event → `rebuildPendingFromEvent()` removes from hand for both players ✅ (already working)

2. **Creatures with targeting** (onEnter effects) → `playCreature()` removes from hand locally → `PENDING_CREATED` event → `rebuildPendingFromEvent()` removes from hand for both players ✅ (already working)

3. **Creatures without targeting** → `playCreature()` removes from hand locally → `CARD_PLAYED` event → `handleCardPlayed()` adds to battlefield but DOES NOT remove from hand ❌ (BUG!)

4. **Spell/Summon resolution** → `PENDING_RESOLVED` event → Card moved to graveyard/battlefield but not removed from hand ❌ (BUG!)

**Fix:** Added `removeFromHand()` calls to the event replay handlers:
- `handleCardPlayed()` (line 681) - for creatures without targeting
- `finalizePendingFromEvent()` for spells (line 841) - when spell is resolved
- `finalizePendingFromEvent()` for summons (line 826) - when creature is summoned

These fixes ensure that both players see the correct hand count after any card is played, regardless of which flow is used.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 668-693 (added removeFromHand to handleCardPlayed)
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` lines 820-856 (added removeFromHand to finalizePendingFromEvent for spells and summons)

**Lesson:** Cards must be removed from hand during event replay for synchronization. Different card play flows (`CARD_PLAYED` vs `PENDING_CREATED`/`PENDING_RESOLVED`) require fixes in different event handlers. Always check ALL code paths when fixing synchronization bugs!

### Pattern Summary: Event-Only in Multiplayer

**CORRECT Pattern:**
```javascript
if (!isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
  // Single-player: Execute immediately
  executeGameLogic();
} else {
  // Multiplayer: ONLY emit event, no local execution
  enqueueMatchEvent(EVENT_TYPE, payload);
}
// Event replay handler: Both players execute the same game logic
```

**INCORRECT Pattern (causes double-execution):**
```javascript
// BAD: Executes locally AND emits event
executeGameLogic();
if (isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
  enqueueMatchEvent(EVENT_TYPE, payload);
}
```

**Effects That MUST Use Event-Only Pattern:**
- ✅ Drawing cards (`draw` effect)
- ✅ Creating tokens (`createToken` effect)
- ✅ Dealing damage (via events like `COMBAT_RESOLVED`, `LIFE_CHANGED`)
- ✅ Summoning creatures (`PENDING_RESOLVED` with `kind: 'summon'`)
- ✅ Playing spells (`PENDING_RESOLVED` with `kind: 'spell'`)
- ✅ Activating abilities (`PENDING_RESOLVED` with `kind: 'ability'`)

**Effects That Don't Need Events (Local UI Only):**
- Opening/closing graveyard modal
- Hovering over cards for preview
- Selecting targets (uses `PENDING_UPDATED` for real-time sync, but doesn't modify final state)

## Comprehensive Synchronization Audit & Fixes (September 2025)

### Bug Fix #4: Systematic Double-Execution Issues

**Discovery:** A comprehensive audit revealed systematic double/triple execution bugs affecting nearly all game state modifications.

**Root Cause:** Helper functions (like `dealDamageToPlayer()`, `destroyCreature()`, etc.) were modifying state locally AND emitting events. This caused:
- **Active player:** State modified twice (once locally, once from event replay)
- **Opponent:** State modified once (only from event replay)
- **Result:** Complete desynchronization of game state

### All Fixes Applied (10/10 ✅)

#### 1. Life Changes (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem:** `dealDamageToPlayer()` and `gainLife` effect both modified life locally AND emitted `LIFE_CHANGED` events.

**Fix:**
- Modified `dealDamageToPlayer()` in `creatures.js` to use event-only pattern in multiplayer
- Modified `gainLife` effect in `effects.js` to use event-only pattern in multiplayer
- Enhanced `LIFE_CHANGED` event handler in `runtime.js` to add proper logging for both players

**Files:** `src/app/game/creatures.js` (lines 233-257), `src/app/game/core/effects.js` (lines 200-216), `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (lines 636-651)

#### 2. Redundant EFFECT_RESOLVED Events (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem:** `resolveEffects()` emitted `EFFECT_RESOLVED` events after already applying effects. Since `resolveEffects()` is called during `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay, effects were being applied AND then redundantly announced.

**Fix:**
- Removed all `EFFECT_RESOLVED` event emissions from `resolveEffects()`
- Effects are now applied only during `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay

**Files:** `src/app/game/core/effects.js` (lines 25-33)

**Impact:** Fixes ALL buff/stat modifications (temporaryBuff, buff, grantHaste, grantShimmer, globalBuff, teamBuff, multiBuff, heal, etc.)

#### 3. Creature Destruction Event Loops (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem:** `destroyCreature()` was emitting events even when called during event replay, creating cascading event chains and duplicate sequence numbers.

**Fix:**
- Modified `destroyCreature()` to check `state.multiplayer.replayingEvents` flag
- In multiplayer (not replaying): Emits events and returns without executing
- During replay or single-player: Executes destruction without emitting events
- Modified `removeFromBattlefield()` to prevent event emission during replay

**Files:** `src/app/game/creatures.js` (lines 167-179, 199-245)

#### 4. Bounce Effects Event Loops (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem:** `bounceCreature()` had the same event loop issue as `destroyCreature()`.

**Fix:**
- Applied same pattern: event-only in multiplayer (not replaying), execution during replay
- Prevents cascading events when creatures are bounced

**Files:** `src/app/game/creatures.js` (lines 53-104)

#### 5. Passive Damage (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem:** `handlePassive()` called `dealDamageToPlayer()` directly without consideration for multiplayer mode.

**Fix:**
- Fixed by updating `dealDamageToPlayer()` itself (Fix #1)
- Now works correctly regardless of where it's called

**Files:** `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (line 261)

#### 6. Frozen Turns Decrement (MEDIUM) ✅
**Problem:** `beginTurn()` was decrementing `frozenTurns` for all creatures BEFORE checking if in multiplayer mode, causing local-only modifications.

**Fix:**
- Moved frozen turns decrement inside single-player block
- Added frozen turns decrement to `TURN_STARTED` event handler for multiplayer

**Files:** `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (lines 417-457), `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (lines 406-413)

#### 7. Mana Spending Documentation (MEDIUM) ✅
**Problem:** Concern that mana spending in `playCreature()` might not be synchronized.

**Fix:**
- Verified mana spending is actually correct (provides immediate UI feedback)
- Added clarifying comments explaining this is intentional

**Files:** `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (lines 89-94)

### Key Principles Enforced

**Event-Only Pattern in Multiplayer:**
```javascript
export function modifyState(params) {
  if (!isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
    // Single-player: execute immediately
    actuallyModifyState(params);
  } else {
    // Multiplayer: ONLY emit event
    enqueueMatchEvent(EVENT_TYPE, payload);
  }
}
```

**Prevent Event Loops During Replay:**
```javascript
export function helperFunction(params) {
  // Don't emit events if we're already replaying events
  const shouldEmitEvents = !isMultiplayerMatchActive() || !state.multiplayer?.replayingEvents;
  
  if (shouldEmitEvents && isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
    enqueueMatchEvent(EVENT_TYPE, payload);
    return; // Event-only mode
  }
  
  // Execute for single-player or during replay
  actuallyModifyState(params);
}
```

### Files Modified

1. **`src/app/game/creatures.js`** - 4 functions fixed
2. **`src/app/game/core/effects.js`** - 2 major fixes
3. **`src/app/game/core/flow.js`** - 3 fixes
4. **`src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js`** - 2 event handlers enhanced

### Testing Recommendations

After these fixes, thoroughly test:
- ✅ Life changes (damage, healing) synchronized correctly
- ✅ Creature deaths synchronized (from combat, spells, abilities)
- ✅ Bounce effects synchronized
- ✅ All buff effects synchronized (temporary, permanent, haste, shimmer, global, team)
- ✅ Frozen creature mechanics work correctly
- ✅ No more duplicate sequence numbers in event logs
- ✅ No more event loops or cascading events

**Expected Result:** Perfect synchronization across all game state modifications!

## Bug Fix #4: Hand Count Desynchronization (Opponent View)

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** When a player played a creature, their hand count updated correctly (showing 6 cards), but the opponent's screen still showed 7 cards instead of 6.

**Root Cause:** 
In multiplayer, each player has their own shuffled deck. When drawing cards, each client draws different cards from their local deck. This means:
- The active player's game state has their actual cards in hand
- The opponent's game state has different "placeholder" cards representing the player's hand
- When a `CARD_PLAYED` event was received, the code tried to find and remove the specific card by `instanceId`
- Since the opponent didn't have that exact card in their view of the player's hand, the removal failed silently
- Result: Hand count stayed at 7 instead of decreasing to 6

**Solution:**
Modified the card removal logic in all event handlers to use a fallback pattern:
1. Try to find and remove the specific card by `instanceId` (works for the active player)
2. If the card isn't found BUT the hand has cards, remove ANY card (works for opponent)
3. This keeps the hand count synchronized even when the exact cards don't match

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js`:
  - `handleCardPlayed()` (lines 708-717): Changed from `removeFromHand()` to explicit find-and-remove with fallback
  - `finalizePendingFromEvent()` for summons (lines 865-871): Same pattern for creatures with targeting
  - `finalizePendingFromEvent()` for spells (lines 886-891): Same pattern for spell casting

**Code Pattern:**
```javascript
// Before (silent failure when card not found)
removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId);

// After (guaranteed hand count sync)
const cardIndex = player.hand.findIndex((c) => c.instanceId === card.instanceId);
if (cardIndex >= 0) {
  player.hand.splice(cardIndex, 1);  // Found it, remove specific card
} else if (player.hand.length > 0) {
  player.hand.pop();  // Not found, remove any card to sync count
}
```

**Lesson:** When synchronizing state between clients that have different views of the data (like hidden hands), ensure the synchronization logic accounts for missing data and maintains consistency of derived properties (like counts) even when exact matches fail.

**Result:** Hand counts now stay perfectly synchronized across both players for all card play scenarios! ✅

## Bug Fix #5: Activated Abilities Only Work for Player 0

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** In multiplayer, player 1 (guest) cannot activate creature abilities. Clicking on activated abilities like "Roar" does nothing, even when they have enough mana and valid targets.

**Root Cause:**
The `activateCreatureAbility()` function in `src/app/game/core/flow.js` was hardcoded to only search player 0's battlefield:

```javascript
const creature = game.players[0].battlefield.find((c) => c.instanceId === creatureId);
// ... and all subsequent references to player 0
```

This meant the function could only find and activate abilities for creatures owned by player 0 (host). Player 1's creatures were never found, so their abilities couldn't be activated.

**Solution:**
Use `getLocalSeatIndex()` to determine which player is the local player, and use that index instead of the hardcoded `0`:

```javascript
const localPlayerIndex = getLocalSeatIndex();
const creature = game.players[localPlayerIndex].battlefield.find((c) => c.instanceId === creatureId);
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/flow.js`:
  - Line 10: Added import of `getLocalSeatIndex`
  - Line 338: Use `getLocalSeatIndex()` instead of hardcoded 0
  - Lines 339, 347, 352, 365, 375, 388, 397, 408: Updated all references to use `localPlayerIndex`

**Impact:** Both players can now activate creature abilities! This fixes Roar, and any other activated abilities on creatures. ✅

## Bug Fix #6: Hand Count Double-Removal (Active Player)

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** After playing Flame Sprite, the active player's hand showed 3 cards but should have shown 4. The opponent's screen correctly showed 4 cards.

**Root Cause:**
The `playCreature()` function was removing cards from hand TWICE for the active player:

1. Line 92: `removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId)` - removed locally (5 → 4)
2. Event replay: `handleCardPlayed()` couldn't find the already-removed card, so it used the fallback `pop()` (4 → 3)

The comment said "hand removal happens during event replay" but the code immediately called `removeFromHand()` regardless of mode!

**Solution:**
Only call `removeFromHand()` in single-player mode. In multiplayer, let the event replay handle it:

```javascript
// Before: Always removed locally
removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId);

// After: Only in single-player
if (!isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
  removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (lines 90-95): Added multiplayer guard around `removeFromHand()`

**Impact:** Hand counts are now correct for the active player after playing creatures! No more double-removal. ✅

---

## Bug Fix #7: Combat Damage Not Applied

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** When attacking with Flame Sprite (or any creature), no damage was dealt to the opponent's life total, even though the combat log showed the attack.

**Root Cause:**
The `dealDamageToPlayer()` function was refactored to use "event-only" mode in multiplayer, which meant:
1. When called, it would emit a `LIFE_CHANGED` event and return
2. The event replay would then apply the damage

However, `dealDamageToPlayer()` is ALSO called from within the `COMBAT_RESOLVED` event handler (line 611 in runtime.js). This created a problem:
- `COMBAT_RESOLVED` event replays → calls `dealDamageToPlayer()`
- `dealDamageToPlayer()` sees multiplayer is active → emits ANOTHER event instead of applying damage
- Original damage was never applied!

**Solution:**
Modified `dealDamageToPlayer()` to check if it's being called during event replay:

```javascript
// Apply damage directly if we're replaying events OR in single-player
const shouldApplyDirectly = !isMultiplayerMatchActive() || state.multiplayer?.replayingEvents;

if (shouldApplyDirectly) {
  // Apply damage immediately (called from event handler or single-player)
  player.life -= amount;
} else {
  // Emit event (called from game logic outside replay)
  enqueueMatchEvent(MULTIPLAYER_EVENT_TYPES.LIFE_CHANGED, ...);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/creatures.js` (lines 249-273): Added `replayingEvents` check to `dealDamageToPlayer()`

**Lesson:** Helper functions called from event handlers must check `state.multiplayer?.replayingEvents` to avoid emitting events during replay. They should apply changes directly when called during replay.

**Impact:** Combat damage now applies correctly! Creatures deal damage to players as expected. ✅

## Bug Fix #8: Spell Cancellation Desynchronizes Hand Count

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** When preparing Firebolt and then canceling it, the hand count was wrong. The active player's hand was correct (6 cards), but the opponent's screen showed 5 cards.

**Root Cause:**
Same double-removal pattern as Bug #6, but for spells:

1. `prepareSpell()` removed card from hand locally (6 → 5) at line 179
2. `PENDING_CREATED` event removed via fallback (5 → 4 for active player, 6 → 5 for opponent)
3. Cancel: local code put card back (4 → 5 for active player)
4. `PENDING_CANCELLED` event handler did NOTHING to restore the card
5. **Result:** Opponent stuck at 5 cards instead of 6

**Solution:**
1. Modified `prepareSpell()` to only remove from hand in single-player mode
2. Modified `cancelPendingAction()` to only restore to hand in single-player mode
3. Updated `PENDING_CANCELLED` event handler to restore card for both players

```javascript
// prepareSpell - Before: Always removed
removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId);

// After: Only in single-player
if (!isMultiplayerMatchActive()) {
  removeFromHand(player, card.instanceId);
}

// PENDING_CANCELLED handler - Before: Did nothing
case EVENT_TYPES.PENDING_CANCELLED:
  game.pendingAction = null;
  addLog([textSegment('Action cancelled.')]);
  break;

// After: Restores card to hand
case EVENT_TYPES.PENDING_CANCELLED:
  if (game.pendingAction) {
    const player = game.players[pending.controller];
    if (pending.type === 'spell' && pending.card) {
      player.hand.push(pending.card);
      sortHand(player);
    }
    game.pendingAction = null;
  }
  break;
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (line 180): Added multiplayer guard to `prepareSpell()`
- `src/app/game/core/pending.js` (lines 232-245): Added multiplayer guard to `cancelPendingAction()`
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (lines 521-545): Enhanced `PENDING_CANCELLED` handler to restore cards

**Impact:** Hand counts stay synchronized when canceling spells or summons! ✅

**Follow-up Fix:** Added `requestRender()` to the `PENDING_CANCELLED` event handler so the opponent's UI updates and clears the active spell slot immediately when a spell is cancelled.

---

## Bug Fix #10: Hand Counts Still Desync During Spell Flow

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** After preparing or cancelling a spell (e.g., Firebolt) the opponent still saw the wrong hand count. Cards sometimes remained in the active spell slot or failed to return to hand after cancellation.

**Root Cause:**
We still had multiple ad-hoc `removeFromHand()` and `hand.pop()` calls strewn across the runtime. They behaved differently depending on who emitted the event, causing inconsistent hand adjustments for the remote player.

**Solution:**
1. Added `ensureCardRemovedFromHand()` to normalize hand removal during event replay (spells, summons, `CARD_PLAYED`).
2. Added `ensureCardRestoredToHand()` to restore cards safely during `PENDING_CANCELLED`.
3. Updated `prepareSpell()` (single-player removes locally; multiplayer waits for replay).
4. Added helper `engageCardHandRemoval()` for future reuse.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js`
- `src/app/game/core/flow.js`

**Impact:** Hand counts stay correct for both players across spell preparation, resolution, and cancellation. ✅

---

## Bug Fix #11: Spell Cancellation Still Sticks for Opponent (SIMPLIFIED FIX)

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** 
1. Cancelling a spell left it in the opponent's active spell slot and didn't show the cancellation log.
2. The active player saw "prepares Firebolt" logged TWICE.
3. Events were being emitted but not properly replayed on the opponent's client.

**Root Cause:**
1. `prepareSpell()` was logging locally AND during event replay, causing double logs.
2. Over-complicated event-only pattern where the active player would emit the event but NOT execute the cancellation locally, expecting event replay to do it. This created timing issues and made it unclear which client should do what.

**Solution (SIMPLIFIED):**
1. **In `prepareSpell()`:** Only log locally in single-player mode. In multiplayer, let event replay handle the logging to avoid duplicates.
2. **In `cancelPendingAction()`:** ALWAYS execute the cancellation locally first (restore card, clean up, log), THEN emit the event for multiplayer sync. This is the same pattern used by all other game actions.
3. **In `PENDING_CANCELLED` event handler:** If `game.pendingAction` exists (opponent's side), restore card and clean it up. If it's already null (active player's side), that's fine - skip it. Always call `requestRender()` to update UI.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/flow.js` (prepareSpell - conditional logging)
- `src/app/game/core/pending.js` (cancelPendingAction - do it locally first, then emit)
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (PENDING_CANCELLED handler - idempotent for both players)

**Critical Bug Found:**
The `sortHand` function wasn't imported in `runtime.js`, causing `ensureCardRestoredToHand` to throw an error and break the event replay. Added `sortHand` to the imports.

**Lesson Learned:**
Don't overthink it. Use the same pattern for all multiplayer actions: execute locally for immediate feedback, emit event for sync, make event handlers idempotent. Also, always check the browser console for errors! ✅

---

## Bug Fix #9: Turn UI Not Updating

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:** The UI shows "YOUR TURN" even when it's the opponent's turn. Players think they can activate abilities but can't click on creatures because it's not actually their turn.

**Root Cause:**
The `TURN_STARTED` event handler updates `game.currentPlayer`, `game.turn`, and `game.phase`, but never calls `requestRender()` to tell the UI to update. The turn changes in the game state but the UI still displays the previous turn's state.

**Solution:**
Added `requestRender()` at the end of the `TURN_STARTED` event handler.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (line 454): Added `requestRender()` call

**Impact:** Turn indicator now updates correctly for both players! ✅

---

## Bug Fix #12: Creatures Not Going to Graveyard + Missing Card Names in Logs

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:**
1. When creatures died in combat, they didn't go to the graveyard on either player's screen.
2. Battle logs showed "is destroyed." and "leaves the battlefield." without the card name.

**Root Cause:**
The `CREATURE_DESTROYED` event handler only called `addLog()` but didn't actually move the creature from the battlefield to the graveyard. The comment said "The actual creature destruction happens when both players call checkForDeadCreatures()" but that never happened during event replay. Additionally, `createCardEventLog()` was using the minimal `cardLite()` payload which only has `id` and `instanceId` but not the `name` property.

**Solution:**
Updated the `CREATURE_DESTROYED` event handler to:
1. Find the full creature object on the battlefield using `instanceId`
2. Remove it from the battlefield
3. Reset its state (damage, buffs, etc.)
4. Add it to the graveyard
5. Log with the full card object so the name appears in the log

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/multiplayer/runtime.js` (CREATURE_DESTROYED event handler)

**Impact:** Creatures now properly go to the graveyard during combat for both players, and logs show card names correctly! ✅

---

## Bug Fix #13: Draw Effect Not Updating Hand Counts for Opponent

**Date:** September 30, 2025

**Symptom:**
When playing "Blazing Inspiration" (draw 2 cards), the active player drew cards correctly but the opponent's screen didn't show the updated hand count.

**Root Cause:**
The `draw` effect was checking `isMultiplayerMatchActive()` and emitting a `DRAW_CARD` event even when called during event replay (inside `finalizePendingFromEvent()` → `resolveEffects()`). This created a complex flow where:
1. Active player emits `PENDING_RESOLVED` event
2. Event replay calls `resolveEffects()`
3. Draw effect emits ANOTHER `DRAW_CARD` event during replay
4. This second event may not be processed correctly, causing desyncs

**Solution:**
Updated the draw effect to check `state.multiplayer?.replayingEvents`:
- If replaying events: draw cards directly (same as single-player)
- If not replaying: emit `DRAW_CARD` event for sync

This ensures effects execute exactly once during `PENDING_RESOLVED` event replay, consistent with Bug Fix #5 where we removed `EFFECT_RESOLVED` events.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/game/core/effects.js` (draw effect)

**Impact:** Hand counts now update correctly for both players when cards are drawn! ✅
